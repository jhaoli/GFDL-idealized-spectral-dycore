# GFDL-idealized-spectral-dycore
This dycore is based on the spectral idealized public dynamical core and extend it for Williamson1992 idealized test and several baroclinic test. Currently. the fllowing idealized test cases are provided:
一、 Williamson1992 shallow water
case 2: steady_geostrophic_flow
case 5: mountain_zonal_flow
case 6: Rossby_Haurwitz_wave4
二、Jablonowski et al(2008)
(1) Steady-state
(2) Baroclinic wave
(3) 3D Rossby-Haurwitz wave
(4) Mountain-induced Rossby wave
