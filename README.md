# GFDL-idealized-spectral-dycore
This dycore is based on the spectral idealized public dynamical core. It is further extended for several shallow water and baroclinic idealized cases. Currently. the following cases are provided:

# shallow water test cases:
+Williamson et al. (1992) test suite:
 + case 2: steady_geostrophic_flow
 + case 5: mountain_zonal_flow
 + case 6: Rossby_Haurwitz_wave4
+ Cross-polar flow (McDonald & Bates,1989)
+ Barotropic wave (Galewsky et al, 2004)


# baroclinic hydrostatic test cases: (Jablonowski et al,2008)
 + Steady-state and Baroclinic wave
 + 3D Rossby-Haurwitz wave
 + Mountain-induced Rossby wave
# Held-Suarez(1994) benchmark
