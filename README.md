# GFDL-idealized-spectral-dycore
This dycore is based on the spectral idealized public dynamical core. It is further extended for several shallow water and baroclinic idealized cases. Currently. the following cases are provided:

一、 Williamson(1992) shallow water test suite:

case 2: steady_geostrophic_flow

case 5: mountain_zonal_flow

case 6: Rossby_Haurwitz_wave4

二、Jablonowski et al(2008) baroclinic test cases: 

(1) Steady-state

(2) Baroclinic wave

(3) 3D Rossby-Haurwitz wave

(4) Mountain-induced Rossby wave
